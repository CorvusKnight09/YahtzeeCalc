# YahtzeeCalc

***(I mainly made this program as a joke, but I actually ended up putting quite a bit of effort into it.)***

---

**This program will:**
- Keep track of the most common numbers that your set of dice roll.
- Try to aim for things that use the most common numbers.
- Recommend whether to score or reroll.
    - Tell you what dice to reroll

---

**Features i want to add:**
- Win/Loss counter.
- Built in scorekeeper.
    - Hidden main program until hotkey is pressed.
- Functional GUI instead of CLI

---

**Have Fun!**
